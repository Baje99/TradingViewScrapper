# TradingViewScrapper is a python software which uses headless selenium and google sheets api to automate the data collection process from the trading view' watchlist column of the logged in user with the parameters entered by the operator. After logging in, it will take the main data from the column (name, last, chg, Chg%) and enter it in a sheet using google api.
Headless selenium is used with chrome driver to automate the login process and login verification within the html. It searches for objects by x.path and it first verify if the used is already logged in. In order to use google sheets API you need to create a google developer account, create a project, create a service account for the project,  download keys.json(you need to download them in the folder where it is your python project) and share the google sheet you want to instert the data to the service account created.
